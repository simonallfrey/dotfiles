:r !tgpt -q 'how to get the ubuntu vesion from bash'
Both commands will provide you with the necessary information about the Ubuntu version installed on your system.
To get the Ubuntu version from Bash, you can use the following command:

```bash
lsb_release -a
```
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
Release:	24.04
Codename:	noble

This command will display detailed information about the Linux distribution, including the Ubuntu version.

Alternatively, you can use:

```bash
cat /etc/os-release | grep VERSION_ID
```
VERSION_ID="24.04"

Or simply:

```bash
uname -r
```
6.8.0-90-generic

These commands will provide you with the Ubuntu version information directly from the Bash terminal.

I'm not familiar with "agagent-zero-data." Could you provide more context or clarify what you mean? Are you referring to a specific tool, library, or concept related to agent-based modeling or another field? More details would help me give you a more accurate response.

commands are several times too long.
